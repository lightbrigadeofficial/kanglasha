# 🔥 About  
I am M Vandam Singha taking this startup on, with my co and heartfelt brother, Kunal Chhetry
We here as BRIGADESTORE want to bring readers together, with common practices and of course a reliable and affordable solution. For nothing in life is a perfect solution, we do not say it a 100% solution but yeah probably the most affordable in online mode in the subcontinent.
For time and the world do not stand still, change is the law of life, and those who look only to past or the present, are certain to miss the future. I said, 'are certain to miss the future!'
