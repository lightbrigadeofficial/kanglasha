                <h4>Steve Jobs By Walter Isaacson</h4>
                <p> Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson is a comprehensive biography of the iconic Apple co-founder, 
                    Steve Jobs. Based on extensive interviews with Jobs, his family, friends, colleagues, 
                    and competitors, the book provides an in-depth look at his visionary approach to 
                    technology, design, and business. It explores his complex personality, ranging from 
                    his genius and creativity to his often abrasive management style. The biography details 
                    Jobs' journey in building Apple, his time at Pixar, and his eventual return to lead Apple 
                    to unprecedented success with revolutionary products like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.
