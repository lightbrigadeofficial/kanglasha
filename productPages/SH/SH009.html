                <h4>Act Like A Lady Think Like A Man By Steve Harvey</h4>
                <p> Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man by Steve Harvey is a witty and candid relationship guide
                    that offers insights into how men think and behave in romantic relationships. Drawing from his own
                    experiences and years of giving relationship advice, Harvey shares practical advice to help women
                    understand the mindset of men when it comes to love, commitment, and family. With humor and straight
                    talk, he addresses topics like how men view relationships, the importance of standards, and what it
                    takes to build a lasting connection. This book serves as a no-nonsense manual for women looking to
                    navigate the complexities of modern dating and relationships.
