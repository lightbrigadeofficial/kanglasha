                <h4>Frankenstein By Mary Shelley</h4>
                <p>
                    Frankenstein by Mary Shelley is a groundbreaking Gothic novel that explores themes of 
                    ambition, creation, and the consequences of defying nature. The story follows Victor
                     Frankenstein, a young scientist who becomes obsessed with unlocking the secrets of
                      life. Driven by his ambition, he creates a sentient creature from dead body parts, 
                      only to be horrified by its appearance and abandon it. 

                    The creature, longing for acceptance but met with rejection and cruelty, turns vengeful, 
                    leading to a tragic cycle of violence and suffering. Through its dual narrative of creator
                     and creation, *Frankenstein* raises profound questions about morality, responsibility, 
                     and the dangers of unrestrained scientific exploration. Often regarded as the first
                      science fiction novel, it remains a timeless exploration of human nature and the 
                      pursuit of knowledge.
