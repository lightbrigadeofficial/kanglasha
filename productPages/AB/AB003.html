                <h4>Gandhi My Experiments With Truth ( An Autobiography )</h4>
                <p> Gandhi: My Experiments with Truth is the autobiography of Mahatma Gandhi, in which he
                    reflects on his personal journey of self-discovery, moral development, and political
                    activism. Written over several years, the book is divided into sections that cover
                    Gandhi's early life in India, his education in London, his time in South Africa fighting
                    for civil rights, and his leadership in the Indian independence movement. Gandhi discusses
                    his experiments with non-violence, truth, and self-discipline, along with his deep faith
                    in simplicity and self-reliance. The autobiography offers insight into his spiritual and
                    philosophical beliefs, his struggles with personal shortcomings, and his commitment to
                    truth and justice as guiding principles in his life.
