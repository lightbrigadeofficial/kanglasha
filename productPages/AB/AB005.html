                <h4>Dreams From My Father By Barack Obama ( PRELOVED )</h4>
                <p> Dreams from My Father by Barack Obama is a deeply reflective memoir that explores his
                    early life, identity, and the search for belonging. The book traces Obama’s journey from
                    his childhood in Hawaii and Indonesia to his years as a community organizer in Chicago,
                    and ultimately his rise in politics. He reflects on his complex relationship with his
                    African heritage, his struggles with racial identity, and the influences of his mother
                    and grandfather. The memoir also delves into his political awakening and the challenges
                    he faced in navigating both personal and societal expectations. With eloquence and
                    honesty, Obama shares a poignant story of self-discovery and the quest to understand
                    one's place in the world.
