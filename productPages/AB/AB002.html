                <h4>Becoming By Michelle Obama</h4>
                <p> Becoming by Michelle Obama is a deeply personal memoir that traces the former First 
                    Lady's journey from her childhood in Chicago to her years in the White House. 
                    The book is divided into three sections: Becoming Me, where Michelle reflects on her early 
                    life, challenges, and aspirations; Becoming Us, which focuses on her partnership with 
                    Barack Obama and their shared journey through politics; and Becoming More, where she 
                    discusses her role as First Lady, her initiatives, and the lessons learned along the way. 
                    Through candid storytelling, Michelle explores themes of identity, ambition, family, and 
                    resilience, offering a powerful narrative about self-discovery and the pursuit of one's 
                    purpose.
