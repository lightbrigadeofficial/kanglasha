                <h4>Mein Kampf By Adolf Hitler</h4>
                <p>"Mein Kampf" (meaning "My Struggle") is an autobiographical manifesto written by Adolf Hitler during
                    his imprisonment in 1924. The book outlines Hitler's ideological views, including his political
                    beliefs, nationalist sentiments, and anti-Semitic ideologies. It serves as both a personal account
                    of his experiences and a detailed exposition of his vision for Germany's future.
<br>
                    While the book is historically significant, it is widely condemned for promoting hatred, racism, and
                    authoritarianism. It offers insight into the mindset that later shaped Nazi policies and World War
                    II. Today, it is often studied to understand the dangers of extremist ideologies and the importance
                    of preventing their resurgence.
