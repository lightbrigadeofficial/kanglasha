                <p> We Were Liars by E. Lockhart is a haunting and suspenseful tale of family, privilege, and 
                    hidden truths. The story revolves around Cadence Sinclair, a teenager from a wealthy family 
                    who spends her summers on their private island with her cousins and a close friend, 
                    collectively known as the Liars. After a mysterious accident leaves Cadence with memory 
                    loss and debilitating migraines, she returns to the island two years later, determined to
                     uncover the truth about what happened. As fragmented memories resurface, shocking secrets 
                     are revealed, leading to a devastating climax. With its lyrical prose and emotional depth,
                    We Were Liars is a powerful exploration of love, loss, and betrayal.
